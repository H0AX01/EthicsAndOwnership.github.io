    <p>»<b>Legal</b> covers the law, whether or not an action is punishable by law.<br>
» <b>Morality</b> concerns questions of right and wrong, and is more often thought 
of in relation to personal or individual choices.<br>
» <b>Ethics</b> also concerns questions of right and wrong, but is more often used in 
a professional context.<br>
» <b>Culture</b> refers to the attitudes, values and practices shared by a society or 
group of people.</p>

<p><b> What is Computer Ethics?</b></p>
    <p>Computer ethics is a set of principles set out to regulate the use of computers. 
Three factors are considered:<br>
» <b>Intellectual property rights</b>, for example, copying of software without the 
permission of the owner.<br>
» <b>Privacy issues</b>, for example, hacking or any illegal access to another person’s 
personal data.<br>
» <b>Effect of computers</b> on society, for example, job losses, social impacts, and 
so on.</p>
    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
      <p><i>There are a number of professional bodies representing individuals working in 
the fields of computing and information technology that have developed their 
own codes of conduct, to which members are expected to adhere.</i></p>
      <p><b>Professional ethical bodies</b></p>
    </div>
    <img src="Officelight.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
    <p><strong>The British Computer Society (BCS):</strong> The British Computer Society (BCS) is a professional body set up in the 
UK:<br>
<b>The BCS Code of Conduct: </b><br>
> The Public Interest<br>
> Professional Competence and Integrity<br>
> Duty to Relevant Authority<br>
> Duty to the Profession</p>
    <p><strong>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)<br></strong> The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) was set up in the 
USA with the aims for:<br>
    » raising awareness of ethical issues<br>
» promoting ethical behaviour among professionals working in the electronics 
industry<br>
» ensuring engineers and scientists respect the need for ethical behaviour</p>

      <h5>What is software copyright?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Software is protected by copyright laws in much the same way as music CDs, 
videos and articles from magazines and books are protected.
</p><br>
    
      <h5>What is Software Piracy?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Software piracy (making illegal copies of software) is a major issue among 
software companies. They take many steps to stop the illegal copying of 
software and to stop illegal copies being used once they have been sold</p><br>
    
      <h5>When software is purchased, there are certain rules that must be obeyed:</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">» It is illegal to make a software copy and sell it or give it away.<br>
» Software cannot be used on a network or used on multiple computers 
without a multi-use licence.<br>
» It is illegal to use coding from copyrighted software in your own software – 
and then pass this software on or sell it as your own – without the 
permission of the copyright holder</p><br>
    
      <h5>What is WWW?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">WWW is the World wide web,it is a system of interconnected public webpages accessible through the Internet. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.</p><br>
    
      <h5>WHat is DRM</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">DRM is the digital rights mangement, it was originally set up to control what devices 
a CD could play on. Preventing a CD from playing on a computer, for example, 
would help stop it being copied illegally. DRM has since been updated to cover 
more areas; it does this by using protection software to help stop the copying 
of, for example, music tracks, video files or ebooks</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Drinks" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h5>What is <b>Commercial Software</b></h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Commercial software is available to customers for a fee, providing a licence 
for one genuine copy to be used on a single device, or a multi-use licence for 
multiple users.</p><br>
    
      <h5>What is Free software and the Open Source Initiative?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative are non-profit 
organisations that promote the benefits of giving users the freedom to run, 
copy, change and adapt software.</p><br>
    
      <h5>What is Freesoftware Foundation?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Free Software Foundation focuses on what the recipient of the software is permitted to do with the software<br></p>
    
      <h5>What is Freeware?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Freeware is software a user can download from the internet free of charge. 
Once it has been downloaded, there are no fees associated with using the 
software (examples include: Adobe Reader, Skype and some media players). 
Unlike free software, freeware is subject to copyright laws</p><br>
    
      <h5>What is Shareware?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Shareware allows users to try out some software free of charge for a trial period. 
At the end of the trial period, the author of the software will request that 
you pay a fee if you wish to continue using it. Once the fee is paid, a user is 
registered with the originator of the software and free updates and help are then 
provided. Often, the trial version of the software is missing some of the features 
found in the full version, and these do not become available until the fee is paid.</p>

    <img src="AI.jpg" class="w3-image" style="width:100%">
    
    <p><span class="w3-tag">What is AI?</span> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a machine or application which carries out a 
task that requires some degree of intelligence when carried out by a human 
being.</p>
    <p><strong>These Tasks could Include </strong> » the use of a language<br>
» carrying out a mathematical calculation or function<br>

» recognising a person’s face<br>
» the ability to operate machinery, such as a car, an aeroplane or a train<br>
» analysing data to predict the outcome of a future event, such as weather 
forecasting</p>
<p><span class="w3-tag">Impact of AI?</span> AI goes way beyond robotics. It covers an ever-increasing number of 
areas, such as:<br>
» autonomous (driverless) vehicles<br>
» artificial limb technology<br>
» drones, used to carry out dangerous or unpleasant tasks such as bomb 
disposal, welding, or entering nuclear disaster areas<br>
» climate change predictions<br>
» medical procedures, such as eye operations where extreme precision is 
required</p>
<p><span class = "w3-tag">Impact of AI on Soceity and economy?</span>As a result of increasing automation over the next few decades, the human race 
will need to consider the impacts that AI will have on society, the economy 
and the environment. So should we all be worried? In this section, we will 
consider a number of existing AI technologies, plus some predictions for the 
future, to help stimulate discussions.<br><br>
It is predicted that, eventually, 99% of all jobs could be eliminated since the 
increase in the use of AI is exponential – competition between countries 
and companies to expand their economies will continue to fuel this growth. 
One question that might be legitimately asked is, ‘if 99% of jobs disappear, 
who will build the robots and maintain them?’ To answer that question, 
let us consider a present-day solution to the question. 3D printers are 
actually now being designed and made by other 3D printers with no human 
interaction – the whole process is automatic with AI algorithms in control of 
the building, design and maintenance of these printers. So, it seems logical 
that other robots/machines will build and maintain future robots and other 
AI systems<br><br>
<b>An increase in AI will leave people with more time to pursue their hobbies 
and have a better lifestyle. Previous industrial revolutions have led to steep 
changes in the economies of countries that embrace the new technology. </b>
